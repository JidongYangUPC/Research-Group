We present a novel passive-source monitoring approach using vector-based elastic time-reversal imaging. By solving the elastic wave equation using observed multicomponent records as boundary conditions, we first compute back-propagated elastic wavefields in the subsurface. Then, we separate the extrapolated wavefields into compressional (P-wave) and shear (S-wave) modes using the vector Helmholtz decomposition. A zero-lag cross-correlation imaging condition is applied to the separated pure-mode vector wavefields to produce passive-source images. To capture the propagation of microseismic fracture and earthquake rupture, we modify the traditional zero-lag cross-correlation imaging condition by summing the multiplication of the separated P and S wavefields within local time windows, which enables us to capture the temporal and spatial evolution of earthquake rupture.
