We present an integrative analysis for the 2020 Stanley earthquake using state-of-the-art methods in seismology and remote sensing. An opposing-dip two-fault model is prescribed to reconcile the observations of aftershock distribution, teleseismic records and near-field InSAR deformation, which includes an unmapped northern subfault with predominantly strike-slip faulting and a southern subfault subparallel to the Sawtooth fault with predominantly normal faulting. The converging fault geometry allows the rupture to traverse a surficial 10-km-wide step, which is greater than the limiting dimension(3-4 km) that commonly ceases earthquake ruptures. Considering tectonic settings, we infer that the composite ruptures involving both strike-slip and normal faulting appears to be typical for earthquakes located near the northern boundary of the CTB, which is different from the predominantly normal faulting in the central CTB.
