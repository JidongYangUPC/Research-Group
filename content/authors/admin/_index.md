We are a group of Computational Seismology at China University of Petroleum (East China). We are working on the high-resolution seismic imaging and inversion for different-scale targets: (1) near-surface structure (<5km),  (2) deep and ultra-deep hydrocarbon reservoir (6km~10km), (3) earthquake rupture, (4) crust/mantle structure.
