we parameterize the wave equation with an angle-dependent reflectivity, and derive the corresponding linearized forward modeling and adjoint migration operators. Because Gaussian Beam migration naturally incorporates propagation directions in wavefield extrapolation, we compute the Greenâ€™s function using the Gaussian beam summation method. To improve the common-image gather (CIG) quality for low-fold and low-SNR data, a shaping regularization over the half-opening angles is introduced in the conjugate gradient scheme to iteratively update the angle-dependent reflectivity model. A flattening-enhanced summation is used to compute the stacked images by accounting for the depth moveout of CIGs caused by velocity errors, and produces constructive stacking results.
