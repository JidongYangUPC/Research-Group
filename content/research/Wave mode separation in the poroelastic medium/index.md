We propose a method based on the eigenform analysis to completely separate the fast P wave, slow P wave, and S wave in the poroelastic medium. Because the propagation characteristic of a slow P wave is different from that of a fast P wave and S wave, the wavefield separation methods in the elastic medium cannot be directly applied to produce a complete wave-mode separation. We first use the Helmholtz decomposition to compute the P- and S-mode potential wavefields to separate the two wave modes. Then, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the P-wave potentials for the solid and fluid phases are calculated. Using the eigenvectors, we can construct the separation operators to extract fast and slow P waves. Numerical experiments illustrate that the fast and slow P waves not only can be separated completely, but also have the same amplitudes and phases as the coupled P-wave potentials.
