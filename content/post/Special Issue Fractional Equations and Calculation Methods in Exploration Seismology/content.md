## Special Issue Information

Dear Colleagues,

Exploration seismology is an interdisciplinary subject involving mathematics, physics, and computer science that aims to utilize the properties of seismic waves to detect the hydrocarbon and mineral resources of the Earth. Fractional equations have been extensively employed in exploration seismology, such as seismic wave simulation, imaging and inversion in viscoacoustic/viscoelastic media, quasi-P and S wave separation in anisotropic media and related applications, and one-way wave approximation to the full two-way wave  equation. Accurately and efficiently calculating fractional wave equations can provide a power engine for seismic imaging and model parameter building in complex media, which are vital in exploration seismology.

The aim of this Special Issue is to present the state-of-the-art fractional equations and calculation methods in exploration seismology. The scope of this Special Issue includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Seismic wave simulation using fractional partial differential equations
- Advanced calculation methods for fractional equations
- Accurate one-way approximation for acoustic/elastic wave equations
- Seismic imaging in viscous and anisotropic media involving fractional equations
- Seismic inversion with fractional wave equations

**Manuscript Submission Information**



Manuscripts should be submitted online at [www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/) by [registering](https://www.mdpi.com/user/register/) and [logging in to this website](https://www.mdpi.com/user/login/). Once you are registered, [click here to go to the submission form](https://susy.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload/?journal=fractalfract). Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the [Instructions for Authors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/fractalfract/instructions) page. [*Fractal and Fractional*](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/fractalfract/) is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.
