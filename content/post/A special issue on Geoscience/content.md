Exploration seismology is a powerful tool for near-surface detection, oil/gas and mineral exploration, geothermal study, and geological disaster early warning. It can provide both high-resolution structural and lithological information after careful and systematic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. With the rapid development of high-performance computing and the increasing challenges of deep and ultradeep resource exploration and near-surface environmental monitoring, the theory and methods of exploration seismology have made great progress in the past three decades. This Special Issue invites contributions from a broad range of theoretical innovations, optimized methodology, and case studies in exploration seismology. The main contents include the following aspects:

​	(1)  Advanced signal denoising and interpolation methods for seismic data; 

​	(2)  Accurate wave propagation modeling in acoustic, (an)elastic and anisotropic media; 

​	(3)  Advanced ray-based and wave equation seismic migration methods; 

​	(4)  High-resolution least-squares seismic imaging; 

​	(5)  Robust model building techniques using traveltime tomography and full-waveform inversion; 

​	(6)  The applications of artificial intelligent methods in seismic data processing and interpretation; 

​	(7)  The applications of high-performance computing in exploration seismology; 

​	(8)  Typical case studies of exploration seismology in near-surface survey and resource exploration. 

Submissions can include original research articles, comprehensive reviews, and case studies relating to the title/description above. Each submission will undergo a formal peer review process, and acceptance or rejection of the submitted article will be evaluated upon reception of the reviews.
