The goal of this Special Issue is to publish cutting-edge research on seismic imaging and model building in attenuating and anisotropic media. To this end, we welcome manuscripts addressing all aspects of seismic processing, imaging, and inversion methods associated with attenuation and anisotropy, including new developments of accurate wave equations, novel signal processing techniques for Q compensation, anisotropic velocity analysis and tomography, multiple-parameter full-waveform inversion for Q, anisotropy and velocity model building, advanced ray-based and wave-equation migration methods, least-squares migration, and deep-learning methods for attenuation and anisotropy estimation approaches, as well as representative case studies in land and marine exploration areas.

This collection on this special topic will focus on original theoretical research, practical methods in production, overviews of cutting-edge techniques, and advanced computational algorithms. The detailed topics include but are not limited to the following aspects:

1. New developments of accurate wave equations in attenuating and anisotropic media
2. Advanced ray-based and wave equation migration methods
3. Stable Q-compensation strategies in seismic data processing and imaging
4. Practical data- and image-domain least-squares migration methods
5. Progress of tomography techniques for Q, anisotropy, and velocity model building
6. Multiple-parameter full-waveform inversion methods in attenuating and anisotropic media
7. High-performance computing techniques for large-scale seismic imaging and inversion problems
8. Deep-learning methods for Q and anisotropy estimation and related data processing
9. Typical case studies of seismic imaging and model building in complex land and marine environments

If the manuscript is for the Special Topic, please choose 'Special Issue Article' and specify the subject of special topic in your cover letter during submission. All manuscripts submitted to the *Journal of Geophysics and Engineering* are subject to peer review.
